          Relationship is just like an ship in the middle of the ocean.You and your partner together have to sail the ship to the shore of your life.If the partner is right then you sail the ship to the shore but if not the ship will be sunken to the bottom of the sea.
          Sometimes choosing persons maybe wrong but after choosing the wrong one gaining the confidence of again chosing someone, this thing was only possible because of you my partner in love.

          When the first glimpse of the beauty came infront of the prince, he failed to recognise her.But god wanted them to meet so they met in this whole world of 8 billion people HE found his Princess and SHE found her PRince in this city of destiny. 
          When god only wanted them to meet who has the dare to stop them. Both needed eachother for their life, but with time how they became eachothers life even they didnt know.

        </p>

        <p>
          Each passing day reveals a new and better side of you.
          Why would i even met you or why would you have met me its all our destiny and by choice we became together. The pure soul of the princess which touched the heart of the prince. He couldnt find out who she actually is until he knew the true value of words one night by her princess. 
          Those words made him forget his past and gave him a complete new lifeüíù. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Prince who used to be the one who never stayed with one girl, but after the Princess he never wanted any other girl exceot his Princess.
          She is the one who changed the life of the Prince.She is the one who made the Prince capable of loving again.She is the one who made him a man , a man who can love unconditionally, a man who can handle and treat his Princess like a Princess and give her the happiness of the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is the one who made the boy to a man. She made it so easy for the Prince to make her his and mark her as his forever ‚ôæ.

          The Princess was never considered seriously by anyone but the Prince could understand the actual value of the Princess, her presence, her smile, her kindness, her pure heart, her pure soul, her love and her body on which the Prince fell more for her.
          She is just as an angel who came to the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Prince is just stunned when he could see the actual beauty of the princess.Her eyes resembled just lke an deep ocean in which the Prince used to sunk in them completely. She could melt the Prince just by her eyes. Her eyes are the deep ocean how someone i flooks into them directly they will get lost in them completely start falling for her more and more.
          Then her lips OMFG said the Prince who hardly could find anything more tastier, juicer and sweeter than her lips.He can never find anything better food than her lips just as sweet as chocolate, little bit of sour which makes the taste more better with some spicyness to maintain the hotness of the Princess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming to her body she is just next level, she had madde such a benchmark for the girls where noone can ever reach atleast in this life. She is the most beautiful girl whom the Prince had ever seen till date. the next girl who will be the more beautifull than her will be the person who wil call the Prince as papa and the Princess as mumma.
          Noone else will come near by that,  the curves in her body omfg just killing the Prince everyday every second every moment. In this world full of makeup she is the only one who is the perfect example of natural beauty üôà.

          That was just her external beauty but trust me guys she is 100times more beautiful from inside.She just takes care of everyone, she doesnt see that the other person is her friend family or enemy, when it comes to help she i ssame for everyone. If she can help she will help everyone and make everyone happy.
          People like her are only available in stories nowadays but the Prince became so lucky to get her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She just wants everyone to be happy, she doesnt care that the other person did bad to her or dont care about her. She is the one who went through so many tough times which noone could ever imagine. She went through such a bad times that all alone when she was just a kid. Its ovious when someone could handle all those thing at such a small age then for her nothing else is a big deal. 
          She made herself so so damn strong that noone can hurt even a inch. She is now able to handle all the problems all alone just one thign she needed was someoneto encourage her and help her knowing her true strength. For this the Prince always promised her to be with her and be the one who will support her always and be with her at every phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Prince wants only one thing that is to make his Princess always happy and make her smile always. She went through o much and thats more than enough now not anymore. From now its just her happy times and this the Prince promised to himself. He will be there for her and can do anything for her. She is just a happy angel from now this is the Prince's promise to his Princess.
        </p>

      <div class="page text-page">
        <p>
          The Prince always adores her and he loves her just the way how she is. He loves her all the things her body her childishness and everything. He would never want her to change herself in any of the case. Let her be how she is and the Prince will also be how he is just he needs to work on his anger issues orelse this relation is the one which will take the relationship to the shore of happiness.
